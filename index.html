<h1> Summer Narrative</h1>

<p> This summer I went to New York with my family, I spent two weeks there, It was really fun! I also played Clash Royale with my friends from Brazil every day. <br> I went to the carnival with me best friend and we had a lot of fun together! I also tried to make a website about fashion, I coded the website in “Code Writer”. <br> And in the end of August I moved from Boston to Worcester. </p>
